# Angular-Seed-for-Small-Projects
A simple angular seed for small projects 

This seed provides a super simple template for getting small projects up and running with Angular 1.6.5
The seed uses angular route so you'll have to setup a simple http server in order to properly run it.

You can use npm to install http-server and host a local web server

To install http-server globally: 
  npm install -g http-server

To start the server cd into your project folder and type:
  http-server -o
  
You should be up and running at this point and have a nice starting point for your next project.

---------------------------------------------

This was honestly created out of need for myself to try and remove the hassle of
of prototyping and testing random things within Angular, as well as to save time when starting 
relatively small projects.
